 *
 * Deliberately strict: any bracket whose content contains a letter, a
 * decimal point, a hyphen, etc. (e.g. "[Note]", "[10,000-40,000]",
 * "[3.14]") never matches at all, so it is left completely untouched by
 * `.replace`. This is what makes the transform below provably lossless for
 * non-citation input -- String.prototype.replace only ever rewrites the
 * substrings a regex actually matched, never the text around them, and this
 * regex only ever matches genuine citation-shaped brackets.

/**
 * Replaces citation markers in raw model text with `<citation idx="1,2">`
 * tags that the Citation component resolves against `sources`.
 *
 * Guarantees (see CITATION_RUN_REGEX above for why):
 *  - Any text that isn't a strictly-numeric bracket run is returned
 *    byte-for-byte identical -- it never matches, so it's never touched.
 *  - A matched run that resolves to zero valid indices (out-of-range
 *    numbers, or no sources at all) is dropped -- only that exact matched
 *    span disappears, the text before and after it is untouched.
 *  - A matched run with a mix of valid/invalid numbers keeps only the
 *    valid ones instead of discarding the whole group.
 *  - Duplicate numbers within one run (e.g. "[1,1,2]") are deduped.
 *
 * In other words: for any input, either the output is character-for-
 * character the same as the input, or it differs only inside spans this
 * regex matched -- surrounding answer prose can never be swallowed.
