# Simplicity

**A free, private, Perplexity-style answer engine that runs entirely on your computer.** No account. No subscription. Your searches never leave your machine — a local search engine does the searching, and answers come from your own AI models: free local ones, your existing Claude subscription, or your own API keys.

## ⬇️ Download

| Platform | Download | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon, macOS 13+) | [Simplicity-mac-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/Simplicity/releases/latest/download/Simplicity-mac-arm64.dmg) | Signed · tested |
| **Windows** (10/11, 64-bit) | [Simplicity-Setup-Windows.exe](https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/Simplicity/releases/latest/download/Simplicity-Setup-Windows.exe) | **Beta — built cross-platform, not yet verified on real Windows hardware.** If it misbehaves, [open an issue](https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/Simplicity/issues). |

### First-open warnings (read this — it's normal)

Neither build is on the app stores, so both operating systems will warn you once. **Windows is the easier of the two** — two clicks and you're in. macOS takes one extra step.

**Windows — SmartScreen.** You'll see *"Windows protected your PC."* This appears for any new app that hasn't accumulated download reputation with Microsoft — it is not a malware verdict. Click **More info → Run anyway**. That's it.

**macOS — Gatekeeper.** The app is signed with a real Apple Developer ID but not yet notarized, so the first launch shows *"Apple could not verify 'Simplicity' is free of malware"* with only Done / Move to Trash. Click **Done** (not Move to Trash!), then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the Simplicity message, and click **"Open Anyway"** — then launch it again and confirm. One time only. (On older macOS versions, right-click the app → Open → Open also works.)

### First launch

The first run downloads the local search engine (~150 MB, one time). If you want free local AI models, the setup screen installs [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for you with one click — or plug in an API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, xAI) or connect your existing Claude subscription for free frontier-model answers.

## ⚠️ Starting point, not a finished product

This is an early beta — a starting point. The core loop (search → sources → cited answer) is solid and tested, but edges are rough: the Windows build is unverified on real hardware, some surfaces are still being brought to parity, and things will change fast. Use it, break it, [tell us what broke](https://github.com/Blueturboguy07/Simplicity/issues).

## What it does

- **Search-first answers** — every factual question triggers real web retrieval through your own local [SearxNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) metasearch (7 engines, no single point of failure), then the model writes a cited answer. The model never gets to "answer from memory" on facts.
- **Behind-the-scenes transparency** — watch the exact search queries, every source found, and each research step as it happens.
- **Deep research** — a capped multi-round research loop that scrapes and reads pages, then writes a long-form sectioned report.
- **Model council** — up to 3 models from different vendors answer the same question in parallel from the same sources; a chair model compares them and calls out where they agree and disagree.
- **Price per query** — every answer shows exactly what it cost you ("$0.0042 · 12.4k tokens", per-model breakdown). Local models and Claude-subscription answers show **Free**.
- **Your models, your choice** — pick per message: local Ollama (free), your Claude plan (free), or GPT-5.1 / Gemini 2.5 Pro / Claude Opus 4.8 / Grok on your keys. Nothing is locked.
- **Incognito threads** — flip the lock and the thread is never written to disk.
- **Export** — Markdown, PDF, or CSV of any answer.
- **Private by construction** — searches run through your local metasearch, chats live in a local SQLite file, API keys stay on your device. There is no server of ours to send anything to.
